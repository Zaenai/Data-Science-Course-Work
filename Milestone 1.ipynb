       "'Donald Trump has the unnerving ability to ability to create his own reality and convince millions of Americans that what he says it is true. The problem with the president lying is that he then believes his own lies. A new poll shows how that can get the country into deep trouble.\\n\\nThe new ABC News/Washington Post poll came out after the president’s physician gave him a physical and mental exam. The doctor gave Trump a clean bill of health, added an inch to his height, and claimed he was fit to serve for seven more years.\\n\\nThis poll was able to capture Americans’ opinions after a new book came out indicating that people around Trump questioned his emotional stability and ability to hold office. In addition, the new poll gave the respondents the time to hear Trump tell the public that he was a “very stable genius” before they were interviewed. He said:\\n\\n‘Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.’\\n\\nThe ABC/Washington Post poll discovered that 21 percent of the people it interviewed believed that the president was a genius. That left a full 73 percent who saw through that lie.\\n\\nThen, there was the question of Trump’s mental stability. The poll found that there was a nearly even divide throughout the nation. When asked if the president was stable, 47 percent of those interviewed said he was not, but 48 percent believed he is stable.\\n\\nThe ABC News/Washington Post poll was taken from January 15 through 18, 2018. The random sample consisted of 1,005 adults interviewed by landline and cell phone in both English and Spanish. The margin of error was +/- 3.5 percentage points.\\n\\nFeatured Image via Getty Images/Drew Angerer'"
