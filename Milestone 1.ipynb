       "'Sometimes the power of Christmas will make you do wild and wonderful things. You do not need to believe in the Holy Trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others. The simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days, as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need. One congregation in Ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on Christmas Eve. The pastor at Grand Lake United Methodist Church in Celina, Ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of Jesus.\\n\\nFor many religious people the message of Jesus is to help others before yourself, to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit. The sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives. Jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time – but what would a generous act look like in our times? That was the focus of the sermon.\\n\\nThe potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation, who were so moved they had to take action! After the sermon ended, the congregation decided to take an offering. A bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this Christmas Eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears.\\n\\nWhat did they do with this offering? Members of the congregation drove down to the local Waffle House to visit the ladies working the night shift. What a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families!\\n\\nThe ladies working at Waffle House clearly were not with their families. They had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills. The congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies, and wanted to help them out. They donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at Waffle House.\\n\\nIn total that amounted to $3,500 being split amongst the staff. What a beautiful moment! What a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon! Doing a good deed like this on Christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at Waffle House. Sure, they could not see their families, but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community.\\n\\nPerhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return. It was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain. It speaks volumes about the merits of the Church in our daily lives. This simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year.'"

      "subscribe to canada free press for free neither rev rodriguez nor pope francis will be there but president trump will be addressing the crowd by satellite it s not really president trump who needs his mouth washed out with soap throwing the spotlight on so called men of the cloth it s not president donald trump who needs to have his mouth washed out with soap for having allegedly made use of the vulgar s word at a white house meeting on immigration there s just no getting around it that some words are more painful than cuss words particularly when they heap praise on abortion advocates members of president trump s evangelical advisory council decided to jump ship for the day and publicly sided with nancy pelosi on daca redstate <date> you have always taken the lead your commitment to the immigrant community to the dreamers is second to none so america is in a better place because of your prophetic leadership on this matter the rev samuel rodriguez who spoke at trump s inauguration last year told pelosi at a press conference on thursday prophetic really pelosi of course is one of the loudest advocates of abortion ever elected coming second only to former president barack obama champion of partial birth abortion how sincere was rev rodriguez when he raised the name of president donald trump in prayer at his inauguration discomfited by the president s use of an expression he has denied using rev rodriguez a member of the unofficial evangelical advisory board and the president of the national hispanic christian leadership conference noted that every single person is created in the image of god and spoke of welcoming people equally from nigeria and norway albeit after a rigorous vetting process later in the day he said more in addition and with great due deference i believe that the comments attributed to our president can best be described as wrong inappropriate and hurtful why because when god looks at these nations he sees his children yahoo <date> it should go without saying that our creator sees among his children millions of babies killed in their mother s wombs sadly the pastor is not the only one who hypocritically regards the president s alleged use of the s word as more preach worthy than the open advocation of abortion isn t it more than a tad hypocritical if not downright sanctimonious that the vatican newspaper l osservatore romano would try a wash his mouth with soap stance on the latest alleged expletive of president donald trump we all know by now that president trump s alleged use of the s word was tattle taled to the internet world by catholic u s senator dick durbin who went straight to the media to report the vulgarity had been repeatedly used at a white house meeting on immigration tattletale dicky durbin continued below the newspaper l osservatore romanothe vatican s flagshipgave trump s comments about the immigration debate in the united states front page attention noting the comments had immediately sparked controversy and indignation never mind that trump denies using the term mercifully the newspaper did not print the vulgar word that automatically spiralled the democrats into a full on faux rage no none of that over here but it s not just vulgar expletives that rile people up some words indiscriminately used to honor abortion advocates are just asif not moreoffensive to the faithful some some pro life catholics must have thought of the s word when reading on twitter that abortion advocate lilianne ploumen former minister for foreign trade and development cooperation in the netherlands was recently honored by pope francis with the title of commander in the pontifical equestrian order of st gregory the great this was one tweet that turned out to be as troubling as it was true the lepanto institute was able to confirm from a <date> dutch radio broadcast that ploumen indeed received the honor in a brief video clip promoting the broadcast ploumen displays the medal while saying that she received it from the pope lepanto institute <date> to say that lilianne ploumen is pro abortion is an extreme understatement and doesn t even come close to the scandalous reality of her activism in january of last year after us president donald trump reinstated the mexico city policy ploumen launched a new ngo called she decides to provide mass amounts of funds to organizations that would no longer receive funds from the us government the mexico city policy automatically denies us funding for international organizations which perform or promote abortion referring to the mexico city policy as a global gag rule ploumen stated that the intention of she decides was to continue support for existing programs being run by organizations such as the united nations population fund unpfa the international planned parenthood federation and marie stopes international she said these are successful and effective programs direct support distributing condoms making sure women are accompanied at the birth and making sure abortion is safe if they have no other choice the lepanto institute continues their ploumen profile but ploumen s anti catholic activity isn t restricted to abortion in september of <number> ploumen participated in the united nations lgbti core group as the first speaker at the event ploumen noted that lgbti rights are human rights in her opening remarks she said we cannot be complacent today in more than <number> countries homosexuality is still criminalizedstigma against lgbt people continue all over the world in <number> ploumen ended foreign aid to the country of uganda for passing a bill banning sodomy and same sex marriage in february of <number> ploumen called on lgbt activists to descend upon and disrupt mass at st john the baptist cathedral wearing pink triangles with the words jesus excludes no one the reason she and other pro lgbt activists were protesting the church s moral teaching regarding homosexuality continued below we already know how pope francis profiles president donald trump in <number> in response to a question about then candidate trump s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall along the u s
